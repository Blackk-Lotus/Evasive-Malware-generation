# Evasive Malware Generation (EMG)

## Project Overview
This project aims to simulate evasive malware using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for research purposes. The generated samples will help improve malware detection systems by offering more advanced training data.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python (for coding the project)
- TensorFlow/Keras (for building the GAN model)
- Scikit-learn (for data preprocessing)
- Pandas (for data manipulation)

## Project Structure
- `data_processing.py`: Preprocessing tools to handle datasets.
- `generator.py`: The code for generating malware samples.
- `discriminator.py`: The code for detecting malware.
- `train.py`: The code to train the GAN model.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies.
- `.gitignore`: Ignore unnecessary files.
