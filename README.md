# Evasive-Malware-generation
This Repository is focused on generating evasive samples for defensive research and improving malware detection systems.
Tools and Libraries
Python (for coding the project).
TensorFlow/PyTorch (for building the GAN model).
Scikit-learn (for data preprocessing).
Keras (for neural network modeling).
Virustotal API (optional, for testing malware detection against live virus databases).
Project Structure 
generator.py: The code for generating malware samples.
discriminator.py: The code for detecting malware.
train.py: The code to train the GAN model.
data_processing.py: Preprocessing tools to handle datasets.
README.md: Documentation for project usage.
.gitignore: Ignore unnecessary files (e.g., large datasets, environment files).
